        <h2>Project 1: Ion Channel Localization at Synapses</h2>

        <p>
          We investigate how ion channels are transported to and cluster at specific cellular
          locations, with particular emphasis on <strong>CaV2 voltage-gated calcium channels</strong>.
          These channels play a critical role in synaptic transmission by mediating calcium influx
          that triggers neurotransmitter release.
        </p>

        <h3>UNC-2/CaV2 Channel Studies</h3>
        <p>
          We study the UNC-2 channel, the <em>C. elegans</em> ortholog of mammalian CaV2 channels.
          UNC-2 is responsible for presynaptic calcium influx, which triggers the fusion of
          neurotransmitter-filled synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane.
        </p>

        <div class="highlight">
          <p>
            <strong>Key Findings:</strong> We have identified RIM/UNC-10 and Liprin-alpha/SYD-2
            proteins as key players in positioning CaV2 channels at the active zone, revealing
            a conserved mechanism for channel localization at synapses.

        <h3>Research Questions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>How are voltage-gated calcium channels transported to presynaptic terminals?</li>
          <li>What molecular mechanisms anchor channels at the active zone?</li>
          <li>How does channel positioning affect synaptic transmission efficiency?</li>

        <h2>Project 2: BK Channel Function and Alcohol Response</h2>

        <p>
          Our laboratory examines the <strong>SLO-1 calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel</strong>
          and its relationship to alcohol intoxication and tolerance. BK channels are large-conductance
          potassium channels that are activated by both membrane depolarization and intracellular calcium.
        </p>

        <h3>Alcohol Sensitivity Studies</h3>
        <p>
          We discovered that loss-of-function mutations in <em>slo-1</em> cause strong resistance
          to the intoxicating effects of alcohol. This finding established a direct link between
          BK channel function and alcohol's behavioral effects.
        </p>

        <div class="highlight">
          <p>
            <strong>Key Findings:</strong> Proper clustering of BK channels at presynaptic terminals
            is essential for acute alcohol effects. Disruption of channel localization mimics the
            alcohol-resistant phenotype of channel mutants.

        <h3>Research Questions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>How does alcohol interact with BK channels to modulate neuronal activity?</li>
          <li>What mechanisms control BK channel localization in neurons?</li>
          <li>Can targeting channel trafficking provide new approaches to treating alcohol disorders?</li>

        <h2>Project 3: Chronic Alcohol Effects and Mitochondrial Protection</h2>

        <p>
          This research addresses <strong>alcohol-related neurological disorders</strong> including
          myopathy, neuropathy, and neurodegeneration. These conditions represent significant
          clinical challenges, and understanding their molecular basis is essential for developing
          effective treatments.
        </p>

        <h3>Mitochondria as Alcohol's Target</h3>
        <p>
          We identified mitochondria as alcohol's primary cellular target for chronic toxicity.
          Our work demonstrates that alcohol exposure leads to mitochondrial stress and dysfunction,
          which underlies many of the pathological effects of chronic alcohol consumption.
        </p>

        <div class="highlight">
          <p>
            <strong>Key Findings:</strong> Elevated mitochondrial stress responses allow organisms
            to maintain normal function after prolonged alcohol exposure. This protective mechanism
            represents a potential therapeutic target for alcohol-related disorders.

          <li>How do cells adapt to chronic alcohol exposure?</li>
